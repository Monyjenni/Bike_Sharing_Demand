## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the number of bikes rented on a given day using machine learning techniques. The model incorporates various features including weather conditions, time-based features, and seasonal patterns to make accurate predictions.

## Setup Instructions

### Environment Setup
1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Notebook
1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open `Source/bike-sharing-ml.ipynb` and run the cells in sequence.

## Model Features
- Comprehensive EDA with visualizations
- Advanced feature engineering
- Multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Ensemble techniques
- Evaluation using RMSLE and RMSE metrics
